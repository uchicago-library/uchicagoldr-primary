# Introduction

The University of Chicago LDR Tool Suite (fancier name pending) is a suite of tools
designed to simplify effectively working with digital materials in an archival setting.

These tools interact with different locations in disk space in order to accession, describe,
organize, track, and provide access to digital archival holdings.
